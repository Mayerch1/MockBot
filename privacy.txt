* automock
* automock excemption

__Automock__
Once a user was added to the *automock* list the ID of the user will be stored into a database, linked to the guild the command was invoked on.
Upon removal of the *automock* entry, the database entry is removed aswell. It is not possible to see which users have been *automocked* in the past.

__Automock Excemption__
If a user was *automocked* and *opts-out* of the feature to prevent being *automocked*, his ID will be stored into a blacklist which is linked towards the 
guild the *automock* was activated on.
Upon deactivation of the excemption, the database entry is removed

__Deletion of Data__
All collected user information
* User ID
* linked guild ID
will be deleted when the bot is removed from a guild, without possibility for recovery.

__**Error case**__
In case a command causes an unexpected error, a so called `Stack-Trace` is dumped into log files.
This stack trace does log the invocation of a command, but does not contain any personal information.
